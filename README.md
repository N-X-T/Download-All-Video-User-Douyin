# Not Working!
Douyin updated can't get all list videos from web version.
I tried to get the api from mobile version and need: x-helios, x-medusa in header. I couldn't find out how to create it so I'll leave it here if you guys are interested ðŸ˜‚:

# Don't support download video make from image -> only download music
# New Feature - Only Download New Video:
-The name of the downloaded video is of the form: id-description.mp4 (lastest video is downloaded is newest video in douyin)

-Get the "id" and enter the prompt to download new videos start from "id"

# How to use:
-Open link of user, example: https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAA5A-hCBCTdv102baOvaoZqg7nCIW_Bn_YBA0Aiz9uYPY

-Open DevChrome(F12)

-Set delay in milisecond at: "await waitforme(1000);" (optional)

-Paste code to console;

-Enter "id" of video, fill "0" if want to download all video;

-View process in console;

-If have any bug, create Issues!
